### Hi there 👋

Here are some ideas to get you started to know who am I:

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a **DevOps engineer**  using PHP, Symfony, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, ...
- 🌱 I was working on testing APIs using Python and CI/CD(for automation), Docker, ....
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Flutter
- 🤔 I'm looking for help to become a good DevOps engineer :)
- 💬 Ask me about how I work and I'll be happy to tell you
- 📫 How to reach me: sowousmane4811@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm still learning, so I can't really help, but don't be afraid to ask. 
- 😊 Here's my site under construction but perhaps useful <a href="https://soowcode.github.io/">here</a>
