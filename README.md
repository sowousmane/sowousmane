### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started to know who am I:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a **DevOps engineer**  using PHP, Symfony, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Nodejs, Nuxtjs, Jest,...
- ðŸŒ± I was working on testing APIs using Python and CI/CD(for automation), Docker, ....
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Flutter
- ðŸ¤” I'll be happy to have help in order to become a good DevOps engineer ðŸ˜‡
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how I work and I'll be happy to tell you
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? ðŸ‘‰ sowousmane4811@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm still learning, so I can't really help, but don't be afraid to ask. 
- ðŸ˜Š Here's my site under construction but perhaps useful <a href="https://soowcode.github.io/">here</a>
